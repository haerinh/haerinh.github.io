I'm Hae Rin Hong, a senior undergraduate majoring in Media Arts and Sciences, on track to graduate in spring 2024. I have a diverse skill set encompassing design and development, with solid experience in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly focused on contemporary web development. I've honed my problem-solving skills through coursework in Python and Java, adept at tackling algorithmic challenges and managing complex programs. My coursework has also provided me with hands-on experience in computer graphics, covering areas such as 3D modeling, lighting, and animation. Additionally, I've gained practical knowledge in full-stack web development, utilizing tools like Flask, MySQL, and REST APIs.

You can find some of my latest projects on my <a href="https://github.com/haerinh/haerinh.github.io/tree/projects">GitHub Repository</a>.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.
