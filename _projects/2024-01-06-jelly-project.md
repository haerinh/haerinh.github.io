  'Jelly Blobs' is a captivating game project that originated from the creative minds of Alice Zhou and Jacqueline Young during their CS 111 course in Python. The project was later adapted to JavaScript, and I took on the task of rewriting and refactoring the game to enhance its functionality and user experience. While I contributed to the project, the majority of the credit rightfully goes to Alice for her original work, and I am grateful for her valuable contributions.

### Game Instructions:

The gameplay is straightforward yet engaging:

- **Control:** Move the mouse to navigate the light purple blob.
- **Objective:** Consume smaller blobs to grow in size.
- **Challenge:** Avoid larger blobs, as contact will result in shrinking.

---

### Educational Goals:

The primary educational objectives of this assignment revolved around the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and inheritance within the implementation. Three fundamental entities form the core of the game:

1. **Blobs:** The basic building block, representing entities in the game.
2. **Enemies:** Adversarial blobs that add challenge and excitement to the gameplay.
3. **Player:** The user-controlled blob, navigating the game environment.

The assignment encouraged a deeper understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application in game development. By implementing and refining these three entities, students gained valuable insights into the complexities of managing object relationships.

### Technical Highlights:

In addition to the core entities, the project involved the implementation of a mouse-movement event handler and the incorporation of jQuery animations. This showcased the application of real-time interactions and visual enhancements, contributing to a more immersive gaming experience.
