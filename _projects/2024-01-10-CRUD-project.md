## CRUD

Explore the Flask CRUD assignment, a crucial web development endeavor centered around the core operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data—commonly known as CRUD. Termed the Flask CRUD assignment, this project emphasizes honing skills in template inheritance, form data handling, Python-based database interaction, and the seamless integration of web pages and forms.

---

### Objective

The project's objective is to craft a web application adept at managing multiple tables and delivering organized search result menus. Throughout the development process, you'll implement template inheritance by creating a base template featuring navigation links and flashed message handling. Subsidiary pages for select, search, and update will provide specialized functionality.

---

### Main Features

1. **Insert Movie:** Easily insert new movie details, including Movie ID/TT, Title, and Release Year through a user-friendly form.
2. **Update Movie Information:** Seamlessly update movie information, allowing modifications to Movie ID, Title, Release Year, Added by, and Director ID. The system ensures data consistency and integrity.
3. **Delete Movie:** Effortlessly delete movies from the database, providing a streamlined process for managing and maintaining movie records.
4. **Select from Incomplete Movies:** Identify and select movies with missing information, such as release year or director, facilitating efficient data correction and completion.

---

### Technical Highlights

1. **Flask Web Application:** Developed using Flask, a Python web framework, to create a robust and scalable web application for managing movie data.
2. **Database Interaction:** Utilizes the `cs304dbi` module for effective communication with the database, enabling seamless retrieval, insertion, and modification of movie records.
3. **Template Inheritance:** Implements template inheritance in Flask, enhancing code modularity and maintainability by creating a base template for navigation links and flashed messages.
4. **Form Handling:** Incorporates form handling techniques to process user inputs, ensuring data accuracy and completeness during movie insertion and updates.
5. **Dynamic URL Routing:** Utilizes dynamic URL routing to enable the updating and deletion of specific movies, providing a clean and intuitive user experience.
6. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful handling of invalid requests, enhancing the overall reliability of the application.
7. **CSS Styling:** Applies a simple yet effective CSS styling using a static stylesheet (`style.css`) to enhance the visual appeal of the web interface.
